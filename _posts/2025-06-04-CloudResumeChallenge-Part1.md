# Cloud Resume Challenge  
Hello, I have chosen the 'Cloud Resume Challenge' as my first project (like many others too). Below is the documentation of what I have done and learnt...  
Full requirements of the challenge can be found [here](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/).
  
## 1. Certification  
>Your resume needs to have the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification on it.  

Completed both AWS Cloud Practioner and Solutions Architect certificate. They will be placed in the **Certification & Participation** section of the resume.  
  
## 2. HTML  
>Your resume needs to be written in HTML. Not a Word doc, not a PDF.  

I have used my basic understanding of HTML (& CSS) for this segment. For the initial skeleton of the resume, I have simply copy & paste the text from my current resume and used containers (div) to manage the structure of the resume.  
  
## 3. CSS  
>Your resume needs to be styled with CSS. No worries if youâ€™re not a designer  

Purely using HTML is quite a challenge to get the proper formatting of the resume.  
With CSS, I was able to almost fully replicate my actual resume. Below are some of the functions I have used to make the resume as close as possible to my original PDF file:  
- Used % for the width & margin:auto so that the page can still be viewed nicely at different browser sizes.
- Used font-family & font-weight to match as close to original document as possible.
- Used margin and padding to adjust any 'awkward' spacing.
- Used inline-block & border-box together with text-align to display the tables.
- Used PowerPoint's color picker to color match the orignal document colours & used its HEX values when applying the background & line colours.

## 4. Static Website
>Your HTML resume should be deployed online as an Amazon S3 static website.

Below are the steps I have taken to host a static website on S3.  
1. Upload the HTML and CSS files to S3.

2. Under Properties, enable static web hosting in S3 and specify the default index document.

3. Under Permissions, unblock public access.

4. Under Permissions, set the bucket policy (remembering to change the ARN)  
   Reference link for bucket policy: [Public Bucket Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html#step4-add-bucket-policy-make-content-public)

5. Finally, access the static website by scrolling down under properties to get the bucket website endpoint.

## 5. HTTPS  
>The S3 website URL should use HTTPS for security. You will need to use Amazon CloudFront to help with this.  

CloudFront provide some advantages such as...  
+ Deliver the content closer to the viewers, enabling faster load time.
+ Force viewers to use HTTPS only.
+ Only allowing viewers to access the content via CloudFront. Hence, disallowing direct access to the origin - in this case, it will be S3.  
  
1. Go to CloudFront and _Create Distritbution_. Choose the S3 bucket (**NOT WEBSITE ENDPOINT** as we will be using OAC) where the static website is hosted as the Origin domain.

2. Under Origin access, choose _Origin access control settings (recommended)_. Then, _Create New OAC_. This step is to disallow direct access to the S3 origin.

3. Under Default cache behavior > Viewer protocol policy, select _Redirect HTTP to HTTPS_.  
>+ Force viewers to use HTTPS only.

4. Leave the rest as default values, scroll down and click _Create Distribution_.  
5. Copy the S3 bucket policy, and return to the S3 bucket where your website is hosted.

6. Go to Permissions > Bucket Policy and click _Edit_

7. Replace the current policy with the copied policy. Then click _Save Changes_.

8. Test if you are able access directly to S3 Origin. It should fail.

9. For security hygiene purposes, go back to the S3 bucket, and revert back step 2 & 3 under [Static Website](#4-static-website) as we do not need the public access anymore.

10. Lastly, access the static webpage by going to the CloudFront Distribution > General > Under Details, copy the Distribution domain name.

12. Enter the URL you copied, change to _http_ & add '_/index.html_' to the back.
    In this instance, it is: http://dgiybnjyd4or4.cloudfront.net/index.html.  
    Check that it should redirect you back to HTTPS. Check the cert if it is valid.
