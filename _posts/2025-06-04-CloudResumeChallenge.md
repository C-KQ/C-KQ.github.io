# Cloud Resume Challenge  
Hello, I have chosen the 'Cloud Resume Challenge' as my first project (like many others too). Below is the documentation of what I have done and learnt...  
Full requirements of the challenge can be found [here](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/).
  
## 1. Certification  
>Your resume needs to have the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification on it.  

Completed both AWS Cloud Practioner and Solutions Architect certificate. They will be placed in the **Certification & Participation** section of the resume.  
  
## 2. HTML  
>Your resume needs to be written in HTML. Not a Word doc, not a PDF.  

I have used my basic understanding of HTML (& CSS) for this segment. For the initial skeleton of the resume, I have simply copy & paste the text from my current resume and used containers (div) to manage the structure of the resume.  
  
## 3. CSS  
>Your resume needs to be styled with CSS. No worries if youâ€™re not a designer  

Purely using HTML is quite a challenge to get the proper formatting of the resume.  
With CSS, I was able to almost fully replicate my actual resume. Below are some of the functions I have used to make the resume as close as possible to my original PDF file:  
- Used % for the width & margin:auto so that the page can still be viewed nicely at different browser sizes.
- Used font-family & font-weight to match as close to original document as possible.
- Used margin and padding to adjust any 'awkward' spacing.
- Used inline-block & border-box together with text-align to display the tables.
- Used PowerPoint's color picker to color match the orignal document colours & used its HEX values when applying the background & line colours.

## 4. Static Website
>Your HTML resume should be deployed online as an Amazon S3 static website.

Below are the steps I have taken to host a static website on S3.  
1. Upload the HTML and CSS files to S3.
<img width="800" height="300" alt="Screenshot of files uploaded" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb9ab80b-9a5f-4221-9a90-31a8206fafb4">  
  
2. Under Properties, enable static web hosting in S3 and specify the default index document.

3. Under Permissions, unblock public access.

4. Under Permissions, set the bucket policy (remembering to change the ARN)  
   Reference link for bucket policy: [Public Bucket Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html#step4-add-bucket-policy-make-content-public)  
<img width="400" height="500" alt="screenshot of bucket policy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6373efc4-fe53-4f38-af79-3ac78ab3c6f6">  
  
5. Finally, access the static website by scrolling down under properties to get the bucket website endpoint.

## 5. HTTPS  
>The S3 website URL should use HTTPS for security. You will need to use Amazon CloudFront to help with this.  

CloudFront provide some advantages such as...  
+ Deliver the content closer to the viewers, enabling faster load time.
+ Force viewers to use HTTPS only.
+ Only allowing viewers to access the content via CloudFront. Hence, disallowing direct access to the origin - in this case, it will be S3.  
  
1. Go to CloudFront and _Create Distritbution_. Choose the S3 bucket (**NOT WEBSITE ENDPOINT** as we will be using OAC) where the static website is hosted as the Origin domain.    
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f49fda7-745f-448d-b658-7a7ac179551e)
  
2. Under Origin access, choose _Origin access control settings (recommended)_. Then, _Create New OAC_. This step is to disallow direct access to the S3 origin.

4. Under Default cache behavior > Viewer protocol policy, select _Redirect HTTP to HTTPS_.  
>+ Force viewers to use HTTPS only.

5. Leave the rest as default values, scroll down and click _Create Distribution_.  
6. Copy the S3 bucket policy, and return to the S3 bucket where your website is hosted.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7ad929e-8d55-400f-a4c1-3488d02a39cc)
  
7. Go to Permissions > Bucket Policy and click _Edit_  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c533e5c-c444-42fd-a8c1-ecd03bf75d25)
  
8. Replace the current policy with the copied policy. Then click _Save Changes_.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6832895-9bf1-42d8-9154-6177fee50711)
  
9. Test if you are able access directly to S3 Origin. It should fail.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60ae6e56-bc75-4953-8aba-00074a162155)
  
10. For security hygiene purposes, go back to the S3 bucket, and revert back step 2 & 3 under [Static Website](#4-static-website) as we do not need the public access anymore.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b098aa-d130-467b-8b72-78eac77a4a2c)
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ee8a4e5-fc57-41d7-8620-e5c0e7984078)
  
10. Lastly, access the static webpage by going to the CloudFront Distribution > General > Under Details, copy the Distribution domain name.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/910c9a27-6359-479b-935a-13929c85eb0f)
  
12. Enter the URL you copied, change to _http_ & add '_/index.html_' to the back.
    In this instance, it is: http://dgiybnjyd4or4.cloudfront.net/index.html.  
    Check that it should redirect you back to HTTPS. Check the cert if it is valid.

## 5. DNS  
>Point a custom DNS domain name to the CloudFront distribution, so your resume can be accessed at something like my-c00l-resume-website.com. You can use Amazon Route 53 or any other DNS provider for this.  

I have registered my own domain on AWS from previous exercises. I will be using the domain to point to the CloudFront distribution.  
  
1. Head over to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), ensure you are in N.Virginia (us-east-1) & _Request a certificate_.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e83459e2-8acb-4fb3-9c4d-39eb7343fb9b)
  
2. Ensure _Request a public certificate_ is selected, then click Next.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd63a781-8b68-4953-9a58-5f4ef8139c8a)
  
3. Under the Fully qualified domain name, enter the domain name which you wished to be qualified. In my case, I selected ckq123.click and *.ckq123.click (for future use (e.g., www)). Click _Request_ once you are done.   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8e2fbbe-104f-462a-9c00-df5705498c94)

4. As my domain is hosted in Route 53, I will create the CNAME records directly by clicking _Create records in Route 53_ for validation. Followed by _Create Records_.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58e3f9a9-120f-484f-8727-740527fdc655)
    
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97c1b973-0c42-46a7-81cf-bbd7ab8e77f9)  
After a few minutes, the status should change from **Pending validation** to **Issued**. Your SSL cert is created.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13b56e8-3022-4595-8fd5-9b4496749183)
  
5. Head back to the CloudFront Distribution > General and under Settings, click _Edit_  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a79ba226-da22-45a5-942f-4b9f04782794)
  
6. Under Custom SSL certificate - optional, select your custom SSL certificate.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/340f68f8-461f-4999-aaea-2d09165adcf7)
  
7. Under **Alternate domain name (CNAME) - optional**, click _Add Item_ and type in your subdomain to be redirected to your distribution.  
8. Under **Default root object - optional** enter _index.html_. So that when viewers access the root URL, it will automatically view index.html.  
>**Learning Point**  
I realised I should have done step 8 in the [HTTPS](#5-https) segment so that I did not need to append 'index.html' in the link.

10. Go to Route 53 > Hosted Zones > Click on your domain > Click _Create Record_  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52da8c14-76c6-452b-91ca-0759d5c02fdc)
  
11. Create 2 records via simple routing to your cloudfront distribution.

12. Test your website. In my case, I should enter:  
    - http://www.ckq123.click
    - http://ckq123.click  
    Both should return me to the static page (resume) with the correct SSL certificate.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b6cccd-1a36-46ed-bbed-24342bc7cee0)
  
>**Learning Point**  
I was having an issue where both _https://ckq123.click_ & _http://ckq123.click_ was providing me with an 403 error.  
Issue was fixed as I realised I needed to add ckq132.click in CloudFront **Alternate domain name (CNAME) - optional** too.
