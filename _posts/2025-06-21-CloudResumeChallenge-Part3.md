## Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)  
Whew... This was more challenging than I expected and I only scratch the surface of it even after completing this project ðŸ˜…. For CI/CD, the task was to create a backend and frontend respository and automate the deployment of resources using IAAC in GitHub Actions. To brush up my understanding of how GitHub Actions work, I read some resources and worked on some tutorials. One of the better resources I learnt from was by [CoderDave](https://www.youtube.com/@CoderDave)'s [GitHub Actions Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLB5MY9BBa4).  
  
For a start, I deployed a simple S3 bucket and uploaded a few files into it using Terraform, just to get a hang of how it works in GitHub. This simple process allowed me to apply & learn three things:
1. Respository Secrets
2. Access Keys and Tokens
3. Ephemeral Storage
