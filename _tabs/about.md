Hi there! Thank you for visiting my blog.  
  
I am an aspiring Cloud Engineer using this space for documenting mini projects that I have done. These projects are used for strengthening what I have learned after passing AWS Solution Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exam & incorporating different cloud software to provide scalable and resilient cloud infrastrure.  
  
Cheers and have a great day! :)
